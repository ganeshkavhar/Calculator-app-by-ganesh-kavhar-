
Creating a New Project
Open the Visual Studio IDE whatever version you have installed on your system.
Choose the Visual Basic templates.
Select the .Net Framework. (Choose the minimum so that the application can run on every Windows OS).
Select the Windows Form Application.
Give the project name and the location. In my case, I’ve saved it with the name Calculator.
Then click on OK button.
